Date: April 2024
Keywords: Statistics, Machine Learning, Gaussian Process Regression, RStudio

Description:
In the Statistical Machine Learning course in a group we were assigned to introduce a new machine learning method/model/algorithm and compare it with a method/model/algorithm learned in class. My group (Josh Seidman, Mark Rupala, and I) looked into Gaussian Process Regression

Assignment Criteria:
- Provide an overview and history of the method
- Provide mathematical expressions of the model
- Explain the model and its properties
- Do a simulation study and compare the chosen method with other methods learned in class
- Include details on performance, advantages, and disadvantages of the method

Contents:
- Final Project Report: Our report that summarized all of the assessment criteria
- Final Project quarto file: Markdown file of all the code we used to produce figures and results
